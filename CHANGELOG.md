## [Unreleased]

Prepped for a 1.0.0 release — not yet tagged or published. See
[`PROJECT_PLAN.md`](PROJECT_PLAN.md) Stage 8 for the remaining release
steps (publish, git tag, manual device-matrix attestation).

### Added

- `encodeToFrames(file, opts)` — envelopes and Luby Transform fountain-encodes
  a `Blob`/`File`, yielding an infinite stream of QR frame content strings.
- `DisplayDriver` — renders a frame stream onto a canvas via
  `requestAnimationFrame` at a configurable fps, pausing automatically while
  the tab is hidden.
- `Scanner` / `Camera` — camera capture and off-main-thread barcode
  decoding (`zxing-wasm`, self-hosted WASM, with an automatic `jsQR`
  fallback if WASM fails to load).
- `StreamDecoder` — reassembles fountain-encoded frame strings back into
  the original file, verifying a SHA-256 checksum and throwing
  `IntegrityError` (distinctly from a generic error) on mismatch.
- `ReceiverSession` — combines `Scanner` and `StreamDecoder` for the common
  camera-to-file case, with `onProgress`/`onComplete`/`onError` callbacks.
- QR encode/render layer (`uqr`-based), tuned for QR ECC level `L` and
  version ≤ 20 — fountain coding already tolerates whole-frame loss, so
  capacity is prioritized over per-frame redundancy.
- Gzip pre-compression and SHA-256 integrity verification in the wire
  envelope (filename, MIME type, size, hash, compression flag).
- An end-to-end loopback test harness (`npm run test:e2e`) covering frame
  drop/duplicate/reorder, a sustained-loss-then-recovery scenario, a
  file-size × drop-rate × ECC-level reliability matrix, and a performance
  regression trip-wire — all camera- and WASM-free, so it runs fast in CI.
- Manual smoke-test examples: `examples/sender-demo.html`,
  `examples/receiver-demo.html` (real camera), and
  `examples/loopback-demo.html` (full pipeline, no camera required).
